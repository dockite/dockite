# What is Dockite?

Dockite is a simple yet powerfull Headless CMS built on mature technologies that gives developers freedom to choose their favourite frontend stack and build using the provided GraphQL API.

Dockite provides an omnichannel api with its GraphQL endpoint allowing developers to develop a set of different user experiences on difference devices from one central robust API.

Dockite is also aimed to be friendly for your common user providing a simple yet robust interface for managing and creating content that will be consumed.

## Features

#### Granular authorization system based on a set of scopes.

Easily define exactly what your editors should be able to view and update using the scope based authorization system.

#### Powerful module system for extending the API with custom business logic.

Need that little extra feature that doesn't exist? Create your own GraphQL resolvers that perform custom business logic and support your needs.

#### Simple field API for development and implementation of new fields.

Missing a core field or simply want to render data in a different manner? Creating and using a new field is simple and painless, support your needs and data storage with new fields.

#### Supports Whitelabelling

Make Dockite yours by using the overrides system to whitelabel the Admin UI, change the colours logos and content anywhere you want by providing a replacement file that'll be used instead.
